# Project based on Embedded AI libraries. 

For creating this sentiment analysis application, I'll be using the Watson Embedded AI Libraries. Since the functions of these libraries are already deployed on the Cloud IDE server, there is no need of importing these libraries to our code. Instead, we need to send a POST request to the relevant model with the required text and the model will send the appropriate response.

Python 3.11.7 was used

This is a part of the course "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" By IBM on Coursera
